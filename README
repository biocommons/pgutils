pgutils -- monitor and identify problems in PostgreSQL databases
2008-08-02 Reece Hart <reece@harts.net>


pgutils consists of views and functions that I use to catch common
problems in schema design, and particularly those problems on which I've
already been snagged.  It's very far from being a complete kibitzer for
all problems.  I will gladly take bug fixes and contributions to expand
its coverage.

The code is released under the New BSD License and available at
http://code.google.com/p/pgutils/ .

The only documentation is `\dv+ pgutils.'. PostgreSQL >=8.1 is required.

Cheers,
Reece
